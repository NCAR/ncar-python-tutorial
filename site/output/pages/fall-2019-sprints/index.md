## Sprints

We understand that there is no way that we can thoroughly teach Python in just three days.  It is for that
reason that we are focusing the entire first day on _real world examples_.  Even then, there is no way to
teach Python in such a short time without having you (the student) actually learn by doing.

In hackathons, participants propose Sprint ideas to the rest of the group.  Sprints are short, well defined
projects that multiple people can collaborate and make progress on during the hackathon.  At the end of the
hackathon, participants briefly describe what they've accomplished during the hackathon on their Sprints.
Basically, Sprints are a great way of taking advantage of the expertise _in the room_ to actually get something
done.

We encourage all of you to come up with a Sprint idea for this tutorial, even if it is as simple as just
converting an existing script that you have to Python.  You do not have to pitch your Sprint ideas to the
rest of the room, but we encourage you to do so.  If you do want to pitch your Sprint idea, perhaps to get
more participation from others in the room, please **add a slide with your Sprint proposal** to this Google
Slides presentation:

## Optional Lectures

After the first day of the tutorial, when we walk through real world examples, we recognize that many of
you may not feel ready to actually _do_ anything with Python.  For that reason, there will be optional lectures
in the Mesa Laboratory's Main Seminar Room that will give you the chance to go a little deeper into various
topics.  You do not have to attend any of these lectures, but feel free to come if you are interested.

All of the presentations on Days 2 and 3 are optional.
