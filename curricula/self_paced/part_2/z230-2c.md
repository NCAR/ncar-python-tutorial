Python 0-30
===========

This is intended to pick off right where part 2b left off - 
you had just created a separate readdata and printing module to remove redundant code blocks from your scripts.

Part 2c - First Python Package Cont
--------------------------------------

24. move to numpy
    
    Conda install numpy
    And use numpy so you can pass in a list without having to do for loops and zip
    convert all 3 scripts to work well with numpy

25. plot time vs dpt, time vs humidity, etc in matplotlib
    conda install matplotlib    
    
26.     contours of dewpoint, axis of temperature and humidity.
    but they'd need mapping of dewpoint to 2d (or use numpy to generate a new table of temp and humiity that we compute on)

27. get a different data set - satellite data LENS data
        take something from the geocat examples (great way to show gallery to recovering NCL users)
