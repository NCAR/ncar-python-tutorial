Python 0-30
===========

This is intended to pick off right after part 2a - 
you had just created a separate readdata, printing, 
and computation module to remove redundant code 
blocks from your scripts.

Part 2b - First Python Package Cont
--------------------------------------

18. [python] Add a function for calculating dew 
    point temperature to your `computation.py` module:

    Now calculate dew point temperature. The 
    formula for this is:
    
        Gamma = log(Humidity) + (b * Temperature) / (c + Temperature)
    
        DPT = c * Gamma / (b - Gamma)

    Where DPT represents Dew Point Temperature in 
    Degrees C, Humidity is in %, Temeprature is in 
    degrees C, a = 6.112 mbar, b = 18.678, and 
    c = 257.14 degrees C.

    In order to do a natural logorithm, we will 
    need to import our first external module: math.

    Then write the function:
    
    ```python
    import math

    def compute_dewpoint(temp, hum):
        """
        Compute the dew point temperature given the temperature and humidity

        Parameters:
                temp: The temperature in units of F
                humL: The relative humidity in units of %
        """

        tempC = (temp - 32) * 5 / 9 #F to C
        rh = hum / 100
        
        a = 6.112 #mbar
        b = 18.678
        c = 257.14 #degC

        gamma = math.log(rh) + (b * tempC) / (c + tempC)
        tdp = c * gamma / (b - gamma)

        tdp_F = 9 / 5 * tdp + 32 # convert C to F
        return tdp_F
        ```

18. [git] Add and commit `computation.py`
   (`git commit -m "Function for Computing DPT"`)

19. [bash] Make a copy of your second script:
   
   ```bash
   $ cp windchillcomp.py dewpointtempcomp.py
   ```

20. [git] Add and commit `dewpointtempcomp.py`
   (`git commit -m "Creating a 3rd Script or DPT calculation"`)

21. Edit `dewpointtempcomp.py` 

    Make changes to the import statements to include:

    ```python
    from computation.py import compute_dewpoint
    ```

    And change your columns and types to include `dewpt`:

    ```python
    #columns names and column indices to read
    columns = {'date':0 , 'time':1, 'tempout':2, 'humout':5, 'dewpt':6}

    #data types for each column (only if non-string)
    types = {'tempout':float, 'humout':float, 'dewpt':float}
    ```

    And finally, make changes to the function call and print statements:

    ```python
    #calculate dewpointtemp
    dewpointtemp = [compute_dewpoint(t, h) for t, h in zip(data['tempout'], data['humout'])]

    #Output comparison of data
    print_comparison('DEW PT', data['date'], data['time'], data['dewpt'], dewpointtemp)
    ```

22. [git] add and commit
    
    ```bash
    commit -m "Computed dew point temperature"
    ```

23. Learn more about the math module!

    Hopefully since you already imported code from 
    your readdata, printing, and computation modules, 
    importing from an external module `math` seemed 
    a little less intimidating.

    You only used the `math.log` function, but some 
    other common methods within `math` include:
    
        `math.pi` which is the value of pi
        `math.tan(x)` which returns the tangent of x radiance
        `math.radians(x)` which converts angle x from degrees to radians
        `math.log10()` which returns the base-10 logarithm of x
    
    Just to name a few.

    You can read more about this module here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

==========================

That concludes the second lesson of this virtual 
tutorial Part 2. 

You should now be familiar with importing external modules
and some methods within the `math` module - specifically 
the log method.
