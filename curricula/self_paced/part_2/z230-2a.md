Part 2a - First Python Package
---------------------------------------

Welcome to part 2. In this section you will continue learning Python, and learn about Python packages which will make your complicated analysis methods easier to write and read.

Open a terminal to begin and make sure you are in the NCAR_python_tutorial_2020 directory.

1. [bash] Make a copy of your first script with a new name:
   
   ```bash
   $ cp windchillcomp.py heatindexcomp.py
   ```

2. [git] And add and commit this new file.
   (`git commit -m "Copying first script to start second"`)

3. [python] Now you will compute the Heat Index.

    Like windchill, which is a measure of how much colder the weather feels to the human body due to windspeed, heat index is a measure of how much hotter the weather feels to the human body due to humidity. The Rothfusz formula for heat index is:

    HI = a + (b * Temperature) + (c * Humidity) + (d * Temperature * Humidity) + (e * Temperature^2) + (f * Humidity^2) + (g * Temperature^2 * Humidity) + (h * Temperature * Humidity^2) + (i * Temperature^2 * Humidity^2)

    where HI is the Heat Index, Temperature is in degrees F, Humidity is in %, a = -42.379, b = 2.04901523, c = 10.14333127, d = 0.22475541, e = 0.00683783, f = 0.05481717, g = 0.00122874, h = 0.00085282, and i = 0.00000199. The Roothfusz regression is not valid for extreme temperature or hummidity conditions.

    Replace the `compute_windchill` function with
    a `compute_heatindex` function:
   
   ```python
   # Compute the heat index
   def compute_heatindex(temp, hum):
       a = -42.379
       b = 2.04901523
       c = 10.14333127
       d = 0.22475541
       e = 0.00683783
       f = 0.05481717
       g = 0.00122874
       h = 0.00085282
       i = 0.00000199

       rh = hum / 100

       hi = a + (b * temp) + (c * rh) + (d * temp * rh) 
       + (e * temp^2) + (f * rh^2) + (g * temp^2 * rh) 
       + (h * temp * rh^2) + (i * temp^2 * rh^2)
       return hi
   ```
   
   Change the columns we read from the data file to get humidity and the correct heat index values:
   
   ```python
   columns = {'date': 0, 'time': 1, 'tempout': 2, 'humout': 5,
              'heatindex': 13}
   ```
   
   and specify in our types `dict` that we want `floats`:
   
   ```python
    types = {'tempout': float, 'humout': float, 'heatindex': float}
   ```

   Update the rest of the script to match
   
   ```python
   # Let's actually compute the heat index
   heatindex = []
   for temp, hum in zip(data['tempout'], data['humout']):
       heatindex.append(compute_heatindex(temp, hum))

   # Output comparison of data
   print('                ORIGINAL  COMPUTED')
   print(' DATE    TIME  HEAT INDX HEAT INDX DIFFERENCE')
   print('------- ------ --------- --------- ----------')
   for date, time, hi_orig, hi_comp in zip(data['date'], data['time'], data['heatindex'], heatindex):
       print(f'{date} {time:>6} {hi_orig:9.6f} {hi_comp:9.6f} {hi_orig-hi_comp:10.6f}')
   ```
   
   Run this script and see the results. 

   So in this step you have quickly revisited all of the concepts from part 1 but no new concepts were introduced. Please reach out if this was too quick.

4. [git] Stage and commit this new script.
   (`git commit -m "Updating new heat index script"`)

5. [bash] Now, you have two scripts that do very similar things.
   In fact, all of the data reading and parsing code is duplicated!
   And the output is similarly formatted, too.  
   
   Create a new file called `readdata.py`:
   
   ```python
   def read_data(columns, types={}, filename="data/wxobs20170821.txt"):
       """
       Read data from CU Boulder Weather Station data file
       
       Parameters:
           columns: A dictionary of column names mapping to column indices
           types: A dictionary of column names mapping to types to which
               to convert each column of data
           filename: The string path pointing to the CU Boulder Weather
               Station data file
       """

       # Initialize my data variable
       data = {}
       for column in columns:
           data[column] = []

       # Read and parse the data file
       with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:

           # Read the first three lines (header)
           for _ in range(3):
               datafile.readline()

           # Read and parse the rest of the file
           for line in datafile:
               split_line = line.split()
               for column in columns:
                   i = columns[column]
                   t = types.get(column, str)
                   value = t(split_line[i])
                   data[column].append(value)

       return data
   ```
   
   In doing so, you have moved your common code, the function for reading the file 
   from both the windchill and heatindex file to its own file.

    And you've made some changes to the function, most notably we've introduced 
    keyword arguments - when you see types={} it means that types is presumed to 
    be an empty dictionary if you don't specify it (and so you don't have to specify 
    it every time you call the function when this keyword isn't relevant). 
    
    Similarly you've specified a filename that is used as long as the user doesn't 
    specify a different file. Keyword arguments also can be called in any order.

    Another change to youur function is the inclusion of a docstrings. The "Read data 
    from CU Boulder Weather Station data file" describing the utility of the function 
    and the list of parameters are standard information included in a docstring.

    This new file is a *module*. Modules are simply files containing Python code, meant
    to be called up within a different Python script.

6. [git] Stage and commit this new file
   (`git commit -m "Adding new readdata module"`)

7. [python] Amend your two Python scripts by first deleting
   the equivalent read-file code in them.
   
   Then, add the following import statement to the top of each script:
   
   ```python
   from readdata import read_data   
   ```
   
   And finally, after the initializations of the `columns` and `types`
   variables, replace the deleted code with a function call.
   
   ```python
   # Read data from file
   data = read_data(columns, types=types)
   ```
   
   Test out both of these scripts to make sure they still work!
   
   In python you can call up functionality from scripts outside of your 
   active script using the 'import' statement. Here we import our read_data 
   function from the readdata module. And now we can call up the function 
   from these scripts. This looks cleaner!

8. [git] Do a `git status` now.  Do you notice something new?  Running
   our new scripts created the `__pycache__` directory.  
   
   What is `__pycache__?
   When you run a python program with an `import` command, Python learns that
   you have written code that you may call again. The interpreter compiles your scripts 
   to bytecode and stores them in a cache, making your scripts run a little faster next time. 
   As a user can for the most part ignore this new folder. 
   If you change or delete your scripts they will be recompiled and reappear in this 
   folder.

   However, you *don't* want to add this directory to our project repository, so before you
   commit anything, tell git to ignore it!
   
   Create a new file (in the top-level directory of your project) called
   `.gitignore` with the following contents:
   
   ```text
   __pycache__/
   ```
   
   Do another `git status`.  What do you see?
   
   Now, instead of `__pycache__` being listed as "untracked", you see
   `.gitignore` being listed as "untracked"...and no mention of `__pycache__`.
   
   Stage and commit the new `.gitignore` file.
   (`git commit -m "Ignoring pycache"`)
   
   Finally, do another `git status`.  Notice that
   the edits you made to your two scripts have still not been committed to
   the project repository!  Because they weren't staged before the last
   commit.
   
9. [git] Stage *both files* and commit all new changes in one commit
   (`git commit -m "Refactor scripts to use new module"`)

10. [python] There is still have some duplicated code in the two scripts.  Namely, the
   final output code is mostly the same. 
   
   Create another module file called `printing.py` with the following
   contents:
   
   ```python
   def print_comparison(name, date, time, original_data, computed_data):
       """
       Print a comparison of two timeseries (original and computed)

       Parameters:
           name: A string name for the data being compared. (Limited
               to 9 characters in length)
           date: List of strings representing the dates for each data element
           time: List of strings representing time of day for each data element
           original_data: List of original data (floats)
           computed_data: List of computed data (floats)
       """

       print(f'                ORIGINAL  COMPUTED')
       print(f' DATE    TIME  {name.upper():>9} {name.upper():>9} DIFFERENCE')
       print(f'------- ------ --------- --------- ----------')
       for date, time, orig, comp in zip(date, time, original_data, computed_data):
           print(f'{date} {time:>6} {orig:9.6f} {comp:9.6f} {orig-comp:10.6f}')
   ```

   the only new functionality shown here is string.upper(), which capitalzes all lower case letters in a string
   
   Edit the two scripts to use this new module (similar methods to step #7) Test your results.
   
   Try to do this on your own first, but if you are getting error messages the solution looks like:
  
   1.  Add the `from printing import print_comparison` line to the top
   of each script

   2. Replace the printing output section at the bottom
   of each script with:
   
   ```python
   print_comparison('WINDCHILL', data['date'], data['time'], data['windchill'], windchill)
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```python
   print_comparison('HEAT INDX', data['date'], data['time'], data['heatindex'], heatindex)
   ```

11. [git] Stage all changes and commit (`git commit -m "Creating printing module"`)

12. [python] We now have 2 different modules related to the same project.  We could
   have put all of these new functions into the same module, but it is best practice
   to separate different functions into different modules depending upon the kind of
   functionality they represent.  In this case, we've separated out the concepts of
   "data input" and "printing output" into different modules.
   
   We could also do the same thing with the computation functions that we've already
   created, `compute_windchill` and `compute_heatindex`.
   
   Exercise: Let's move these functions into a new module called `computation.py`, 
   and modify the scripts to use this new module.  Remember to add docstrings!
   
   Solution: I did the following:
   
   ```python
   def compute_windchill(temp, windspeed):
       """
       Compute the wind chill factor given the temperature and wind speed

       NOTE: This computation is valid only for temperatures between
       -45F and +45F and for wind speeds between 3 mph and 60 mph.

       Parameters:
           temp: The temperature in units of F
           windspeed: The wind speed in units of mph
       """

       v16 = windspeed ** 0.16
       return 35.74 + 0.6215*temp - 35.75*v16 + 0.4275*temp*v16


   def compute_heatindex(temp, hum):
       """
       Compute the heat index given the temperature and the humidity

       Parameters:
           temp: The temperature in units of F
           hum: The relative humitidy in units of %
       """

       T = temp
       H = hum / 100
       HI = (-42.379 + 2.04901523*T + 10.14333127*H -
             0.22475541*T*H - 6.83783e-3*T**2 - 5.481717e-2*H**2 +
             1.22874e-3*T**2*H + 8.5282e-4*T*H**2 -
             1.99e-6*T**2*H**2)
       return HI
   ```
   
   And then modified the scripts accordingly.

13. [git] Stage and commit everything (`git commit -m "Creating computation module"`)

14. [python] Now, we've got quite a few Python files in our main directory.
   Which ones are scripts?  Which ones are modules meant to be imported?
   
   Typically, we group all of the modules meant for import only into another
   directory called a *package*.  A *package* is a directory with a `__init__.py`
   file inside it.
   
   So, let's create a new directory called `mysci` and create an empty file in it
   called `__init__.py`:
   
   ```bash
   $ mkdir mysci
   $ cd mysci
   $ touch __init__.py
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
   Then, let's move our 3 modules into this package:
   
   ```bash
   $ git mv readdata.py mysci/
   $ git mv printing.py mysci/
   $ git mv computation.py mysci/
   ```
   
   Then, let's modify the import statements at the top of our two scripts so
   that the modules are automatically imported from the new package:
   
   ```python
   from mysci.readdata import read_data
   from mysci.printing import print_comparison
   from mysci.computation import compute_heatindex
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Obviously introduces packages.  Should also talk about the
   fact that the `__init__.py` file is run when the package is imported.

15. [git] Stage everything (don't forget the `__init__.py` file!) and
   commit (`git commit -m "Creating mysci package"`)
   
   **NOTE:** Our commits are getting bigger, but that's okay.  Each commit
   corresponds to a *single* (conceptually) change to the codebase.
   
   With this last change, our project should look like this (ignoring the
   `__pycache__` directories:
   
   ```text
   mysci/
   
       data/
           wxobs20170821.txt
           
       mysci/
           __init__.py
           readdata.py
           printing.py
           computation.py
           
       heatindexcomp.py
       windchillcomp.py
   ```

16. [python] Let's take a brief aside and look at the use of the computation
   functions in our scripts.  In the case of the wind chill factor computation,
   it looks like this:
   
   ```python
   windchill = []
   for temp, windspeed in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed']):
       windchill.append(compute_windchill(temp, windspeed))
   ```
   
   This divides the initialization of the `windchill` variable as an empty `list`
   from the "filling" of that `list` with computed values.
   
   Python gives you some shortcuts to doing this via a concept called 
   "comprehensions", which are ways of initializing containers (`list`s,
   `dict`s, etc.) with an *internal loop*.  For example, we could have
   written the previous 3 lines in the form of a "one-liner" like so:
   
   ```python
   windchill = [compute_windchill(t, w) for t, w in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed'])]
   ```
   
   This is a *list comprehension*, and it initializes the entire list with the
   computed contents, rather than initializing an empy list and appending values
   to it after the fact.  Computationally, this is actually *more efficient*.
   
   Exercise: Use list comprehensions to make the computation steps in both of
   our scripts one-liners.
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces list comprehensions.  Should also mention dict comprehensions.
   Should also mention *conditional* comprehensions (i.e., `for ... in ... if` statements)

17. [git] Stage and commit changes (`git commit -m "Using list comprehensions"`)
==========================

Okay that concludes the first lesson of this virtual tutorial Part 2. 
You should now be familiar with modules, using the import statement, 
some more f-string formatting options, __pycache__, and gitignore. 

Please continue to part 2b.
