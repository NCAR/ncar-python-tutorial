# 3-5 June, 2019 : CGD-CISL Python Tutorial and Hackathon

The objectives:

- Spin up on Python as an analysis tool (zero to 60)
- Work through example analyses, from number crunching to visualization
- Understand Python package design
- Gain familiarity with git workflow and package development
- Tackle a collaborative coding project
- Something else you think is missing?

The format of this event will include instructional lectures as well as open-ended project time. The expectation is that participants will work collaboratively on projects of personal interest.

### Location
